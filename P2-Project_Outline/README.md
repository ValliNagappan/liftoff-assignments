### Overview
Our project will be a budget planner that will allow the user to track their expenses by category. Users will be able to crwate an account, login, enter their expenses and update or remove expenses. They will be able to review all of the expenses in a pictorial representation.

This idea came to me because as being a parent and mother of 2 kids, I always find ways to save money while having many expenses in home. So it will be useful for other parents as well.
